## Column headers (verbatim)

### Included Articles (43 columns)

Note: this sheet uses **three header rows**. Row 1 provides grouped bands (e.g., Gender/Site/Primary cause/Type of ARDs), row 2 breaks those into specific fields (e.g., Male/Female, Maxilla/Mandible/Both), and row 3 further splits the ARD subtypes and MRONJ stage. The per-column list below reflects the **combined per-column prompts** from rows 1–3 (so every blank header cell becomes a distinct subquestion).
