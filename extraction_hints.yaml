title: Extraction hints by feature/item
summary: >
  Structured, single-source extraction rules for humans and the LLM. Use ONLY the
  provided paper text; do not guess. Prefer explicit statements. Return null when
  ambiguous or not reported.

global_rules:
  - Use ONLY the provided text; do not guess.
  - If not reported, return null.
  - For 1/0 flag fields: use 1 when explicitly present, otherwise null.
  - Evidence must be short (1 sentence), no long quotes.
  - If a page number can be inferred from a snippet header (e.g., "--- PAGE 3"), include that page.
  - Return strict JSON matching the schema.
  - >
    Keep values structured: numbers as numbers (not strings), enums/tokens exactly as defined,
    and free-text fields concise.

  awmf_s3_alignment:
    purpose: >
      This extraction output is an input artifact for an AWMF S3 guideline workflow.
      It does NOT replace evidence synthesis, GRADE profiling, or recommendations.
    required_next_layer:
      - Define PICO and outcome prioritization.
      - Perform evidence synthesis (effect sizes, meta-analysis, heterogeneity, bias checks).
      - Build evidence profiles (often GRADE) and summary-of-findings tables.
      - Document evidence-to-decision and consensus/recommendation process.
    usage_notes:
      - Only populate level_of_evidence or grade_of_recommendation if explicitly stated
        or if the run provides a predefined framework mapping.
      - Use study_design tokens that match the Excel template validations whenever possible.
